# Arduino Alarm â€“ Motion Detection in Your Local Network  

## Tired of your mom yelling at you for playing Minecraft at 2 AM?  
### Meet Arduino Alarm  

Arduino Alarm is a simple motion detection system that notifies you through a webpage on your local network.  

- When no motion is detected, the page remains **black**.  
- When motion is detected, the page turns **red** to alert you.  

### How It Looks

## Setup  
### Requirements  
- **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi**  
- **PIR Motion Sensor**  

### 1. Download the Project Files  
- Set the **signal pin** in the code (e.g., pin **13**, line 3).

### 3. Get the Device IP Address  
Open the **Serial Monitor** (9600 baud) to see:  
- **Device IP address**  
- **Wi-Fi signal strength**  
- **Any potential errors**

### 4. Test the System  
- Enter the **device's IP address** in your browser.  
- Check if motion detection works as expected.  

That's it. Your motion detection system is now up and running.
